METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:	METHODS
Organismal collections were made along three transects from ~40m:5m depth set ~100m apart at each site. Includes opportunistic hand collections by SCUBA divers, incidental collection during algal collections, and targeted suction sampling (pooled between 22m:18 and 8m:12m). Species were identified to lowest taxonomic level possible, pending identification of voucher samples by taxonomic experts. Sites were selected to cover a gradient of mean annual ice cover.

Up to five individuals of each species per site were collected for fatty acid biomarkers), three of which will also be used for stable isotope analysis. 
	
Methods for processing the data:	METHODS
Data were entered by hand and transfered to a spreadsheet. Organismal names were QC'd via R script using the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS: http://www.marinespecies.org/) database to verify proper usage and spelling of names. 
	
Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:	NA
	
Standards and calibration information, if appropriate:	NA
	
Environmental/experimental conditions:	CONDITIONS
All organisms were collected from benthic substrate by hand, or via suction sampler operated by SCUBA divers. 
	
Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:	
- Initial species name QC done via R script against the WoRMS database (package: worrms)
	
People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission:	PARTICIPANTS
